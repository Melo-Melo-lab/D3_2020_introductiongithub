  <h1>fable de aeson</h1>

    <div class="block-item-01">
      <p>A certain braggadocio of the chace
Rad lost a hound of an uncommon race,
Suspected he had passed some lion's maw,
          And asked a shepherd whom he saw :
“ Give me the thief's address, good friend,” he cried,
“ That I may glut my vengeance on his hide.”
“ Close by that mountain,” said the shepherd, “ keep ;
In paying him the tribute of a sheep
          Per month, I wander where I please,
          And thus I live in constant ease.”
Whilst they conversed the lion came that way
With agile feet ; the braggart in dismay
Fled and exclairned “ O Jove ! grant me some hole
That I may hide in while my bones are whole !”
True courage is to brave the danger near,
Nor it to seek, nor shun if it appear.
Many who brag their courage for the fight,
Give it their heels when it attacks their sight.</p>
